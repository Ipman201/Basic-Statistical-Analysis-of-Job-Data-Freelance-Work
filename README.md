# Basic-Statistical-Analysis-of-Job-Data-Freelance-Work

This is my freelance work for my DC Water Company, US.
In this work, I convert the pdf data into single excel sheet. Cleaned and perform analytical insights with dashboard.

### Here are my findings-

Average Salary by Department:
* Board-Central Administration: $170,000.00
* CC-Center of Excellence: $118,703.65 (average of 3 employees)
* CC-Central Administration: $146,944.40 (average of 3 employees)
* CC-Collections and Escalations: $87,394.10 (average of 11 employees)
* CC-Contact Center: $82,358.93 (average of 33 employees)

Highest & Lowest Salaries by Department:
* Board-Central Administration: Highest: $170,000.00, Lowest: $170,000.00
* CC-Center of Excellence: Highest: $155,209.82, Lowest: $98,772.88
* CC-Central Administration: Highest: $188,999.85, Lowest: $105,285.40
* CC-Collections and Escalations: Highest: $121,338.00, Lowest: $53,400.05
* CC-Contact Center: Highest: $129,541.05, Lowest: $70,803.20

The start dates for employees range from 1984 to 2023.
Some employees have been with the company for nearly 4 decades (e.g., an employee from the "CC-Contact Center" started in 1984), while some are very new, having started in 2023.

### Conclusions:

1. The "CC-Contact Center" has the most number of employees, but they also have one of the lower average salaries among the departments.
2. The "CC-Collections and Escalations" department has employees with a higher average tenure.
3. Union positions are more prevalent than Non-Union ones.
4. Bilingual positions are exclusive to the "CC-Contact Center" department, indicating a specialized need.
